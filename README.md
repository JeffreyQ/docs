# Introduction

**Phantom** is a wallet and browser extension that can be used to manage digital assets and access decentralized applications on the [Solana](https://solana.com/) blockchain. 

It works by creating and managing private keys on behalf of its users, allowing them to store funds and sign transactions. 

The extension injects a `solana` object into the javascript context of every web application the user visits. The application may then interact with the wallet, such as asking for permission to perform a transaction, through this injected object.
